What is a hash map? What are the time complexities for common operations 
performed on a hash map?
A hash map is a hash table based implementation of a map which is a array like data
structure that can map keys to values

Hash table uses a hash function to compute an index( or hash code) to put
into an array of buckets/slots
Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, 
but most hash table designs employ an imperfect hash function that causes collisions

Keys could have different hash codes but be stored at the same index
which causes COLLISIONS
1 way to resolve a collision is CHAINING
 store them in a linked list


Given a list of elements, describe the algorithm to return the first occurrence 
of each unique element. Follow up question was to return the k-most frequent 
elements from the list.

Given a list of N elements (non-unique), how you you return (while maintaining 
order) a list of only the first appearance of each element.

How can you determine if a 64-bit integer is a power of two.

Given an acyclic directed graph, find the longest path. 
Follow up question was to optimize.
