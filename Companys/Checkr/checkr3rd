PART 1  object design
ALREADY EXISTING FEATURE FOR CHECKR

eco system with a new feature to implement
focus on domain modeling 
what objects would be useful to solve problem
what are the atrtributes and how they relate and how they in existing systems
flexible approach is good here
write pseudocode to show how itll help implement this feature
miro.com to help

motor vehicle report search

phase 1 simple rules 
data schema and objects to easily approve/report data

phase 2 compound rules implement on first schema 
binary tree?? (huh)
very encouraged to ask and question



PART 2 refactoring  actual coding time limit
time constraint, and make sure prioritize most beneficial refactor and see how much itll take you

PART 3  API design actual coding time limit
build out  an API that serves data that theyll provide at the start of the interview
use any language and framework
prepare by this interview by keeping ur computer updated and datastore. have own boiler code.


PART 4. Architecture whitebording TECHNICAL discussion
Use miro.com

Giving a partial picture of Checkr's architecture and ask to design the rest.

We like to hear the thought process about certain choices.
think about things like how uesrs will interact with product to order background checks.
what behaviors do they expect after ordering
how the product will need to interact with vendors who provide backgronud checks

how to make sure this system is reliable.
wont have time to get through everything and will ask questions to dive deeper into parts as you go.

TYPICAL DESIGN INTERVIEW QUESTIONS WILL HELP PREPARE

EACH INTERVIEWER WILL ASK ME THESE
5 core values
humility
grit
ownership
connection
transparency

MAKE SURE TO DESCRIBE CHALLENGES AT WORK AND ARTICULATE HOW YOU OVERCAME THEM
